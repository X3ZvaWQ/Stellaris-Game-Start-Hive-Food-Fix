## About This Mod

> Paradox's mom bought them a toy ship made of alloys when they were little. Since then, they've been so obsessed that they forgot to give Hive Minds any lunch. Even after reaching the stars, there's zero food on the table.

### Overview

At some point, Hive Mind empires starting with Alloy Ships began spawning with 0 food. While it doesn't break the game, it’s incredibly annoying to see that red zero on day one. This mod fixes that by granting the missing **200 starting food** at the beginning of the game.

### Compatibility

- **New Games Only:** Only triggers on game start.
- **Specific Trigger:** Only affects Hive Mind empires that choose the Alloy Ship start.
- **Save Games:** Safe to add, but won't apply to empires that have already spawned.
